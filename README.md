# Test Driven Development

> Implement changes through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with focused regression coverage.

This repository packages a single, reusable Hermes skill as a documentation-first public reference. It explains the problem, operating contract, safety boundaries, expected evidence, and example usage without claiming a bundled runtime that is not present.

## Why this exists

Technical work becomes difficult to review when discovery, decisions, changes, and verification are mixed together. **Test Driven Development** turns that work into an explicit sequence with visible inputs, outputs, review points, and completion evidence.

## Why the repository has this name

The shared `hermes-skill-` prefix identifies this as a portable Hermes workflow package. `test-driven-development` names the capability directly—test driven development—so the repository remains searchable and understandable outside the original AI-OS workspace. The public title is **Test Driven Development**.

## At a glance

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | Engineering workflow packaged as a reusable Hermes `SKILL.md`. |
| What does it do? | Implement changes through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with focused regression coverage. |
| Who is it for? | Builders, operators, and reviewers who want a repeatable, inspectable workflow. |
| What is delivered? | A skill contract, examples, safety guidance, release checks, and rendered SVG diagrams. |
| Runtime status | Documentation-first reference package; connect it to the tools available in your own environment. |

## Visual system map

The diagram below is specific to this capability. It shows the real components and artifacts involved rather than a generic agent loop.

## Operation sequence

![Test Driven Development actor and data sequence](assets/operation-sequence.svg)

1. Translate behavior into a focused test
2. Run it and confirm the expected failure
3. Implement the smallest passing change
4. Run focused and regression suites
5. Refactor without changing behavior
6. Record RED GREEN REFACTOR evidence

See [How it works](docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md) for the component-by-component walkthrough and evidence model.

## Example visual output

This is an explanatory mockup of the output shape—not fabricated proof that a live run occurred. The labels show the information a real result should expose for review.

## Decision and stop conditions

![Decision guide for Test Driven Development](assets/decision-guide.svg)

## Inputs

- A bounded repository, diff, runtime, or engineering question
- Constraints such as allowed files, tools, and change scope
- Existing tests, logs, or acceptance criteria

## Outputs

- An evidence-backed finding, plan, review, or implementation
- Verification results and remaining risks
- A concise handoff another engineer can reproduce

## Example request

> Use a disposable sample repository to implement changes through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR with focused regression coverage. Return the result, the evidence used to verify it, and any limitations or actions that still require approval.

More scenarios and expected results are in [Examples](docs/EXAMPLES.md).

## Safety and trust model

This workflow may create or change artifacts, so consequential actions require a preview and explicit authorization. It must stop when ownership, authorization, target state, or publication safety is ambiguous. Never place credentials, private endpoints, personal data, or environment-specific secrets in the skill package or its evidence.

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before connecting the workflow to real accounts, devices, repositories, or production data.

## What this repository does not claim

- It does not replace project-specific tests, code review, or production approval.
- It is not a hosted service, executable application, or vendor endorsement.
- It does not include credentials, private infrastructure, or the original personal AI-OS configuration.
- A successful example does not prove production readiness for every environment.

## Use this package

1. Read `SKILL.md` and confirm its trigger matches your task.
2. Copy the package into the skill location supported by your agent environment, or use it as a reference when authoring an equivalent workflow.
3. Replace tool assumptions with the tools actually available to you; do not add secrets to the repository.
4. Run the smallest safe example from `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.
5. Record verification evidence and review any consequential action before widening scope.

## Contributing

Improvements are welcome when they preserve narrow scope, honest capability claims, safe defaults, and reproducible verification. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
